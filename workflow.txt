1. start a waffle.io issue for the specific task you are about to work on
2. pull from remote master into your local master
3. checkout branch
4. do work, commit.
5. when you're ready to push...don't yet! switch to your local master and pull from master
6. then switch back to your branch and "git merge master", this will merge your updated local master into your branch
7. fix any merge conflicts
8. run your tests, fix any broken tests
9. add, commit
10. now it's ok to push your branch and open a PR "git push origin HEAD" or "git push origin <branch name>"
11. open pull request on GitHub.
12. close waffle.io issue
13. as soon as a branch is merged to master on GitHub, make your entire team pull from master



Waffle.io issue structure:
As a user,
when I send a POST request to http://yourapplication:port/sources with the parameters 'identifier=jumpstartlab&rootUrl=http://jumpstartlab.com',
then I expect a 200 response with JSON data like {"identifier":"jumpstartlab"}
