# Rush Hour
## Group member names: Nicholas Dorans and Erinna Chen

What does each group member hope to get out of the project? What are your goals and expectations for the project?
* Being able to use ActiveRecord and Postgres
* Build an application that satisfies at least base functionality as described by the [project specification](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

Work availability:
* Similar schedules, lightning talk preparations
* Goal is to spend Monday refactoring instead of pushing functionality; Mostly done by Saturday, will re-evaluate if necessary

How do you want to work?
* Pair initially to lay some framework, and get a feel for the project, to see where we can divide and conquer
* Workflow: always work on separate branch. Writer of code will pull request to merge onto master, other partner will review code and merge.
* Is a "leadership" role required?
* Be pro-active about reaching out when struggling.

Giving formal feedback at the end is important.
