# Traffic Spy

In this project you'll use Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord to build a web traffic tracking and analysis tool.

Your application will be live on the Internet. It will recieve data over HTTP from a simulation engine. The simulator will construct and transmit HTTP requests which include tracking data.

Imagine that I run a commercial website and embed JavaScript code which gets activated each time a page is viewed on my site. That JavaScript captures information about the visitor and the page they're viewing then, in the background, submits that data to your TrafficSpy application.

Your application parses and stores that data.

Later, I visit your site and can view data about my traffic through a HTML interface.
