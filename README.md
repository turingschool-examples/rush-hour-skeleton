# TrafficSpy
## An application for tracking website traffic

### Authors

This application was created by [Beth Secor](https://github.com/bethsecor), [Steve Pentler](https://github.com/stevepentler), and [Toni Rib](https://github.com/tonirib) for the [Turing School of Software & Design](http://turing.io).

### Overview

stuff here.

### Project Cloning & Setup

Clone the project by running the following command from the terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/ToniRib/traffic-spy.git
```

Navigate into the project directory and run the command `bundle`.

Run the following commands to set up the database and the test database:

```
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:test:prepare
```

### Registering an Application

Applications are registered through the terminal using the `curl` command in the following format:

```
curl -i -d 'identifier=turing&rootUrl=http://turing.io'  http://localhost:9393/sources
```

The identifier chosen will be used to reference that application through the site. If either the identifier or the rootUrl parameters are missing, an error will be thrown. In addition, an application can only be registered once.

### Sending Application Data (Payloads)

In order to mimic data being sent to our server, you can again use the terminal `curl` command in the following format to send a payload:

```
curl -i -d 'payload={"url":"http://turing.io/blog","requestedAt":"2013-02-16 21:38:28 -0700","respondedIn":37,"referredBy":"http://turing.io","requestType":"GET","parameters":[],"eventName":"socialLogin","userAgent":"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh%3B Intel Mac OS X 10_8_2) AppleWebKit/537.17 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/24.0.1309.0 Safari/537.17","resolutionWidth":"1920","resolutionHeight":"1280","ip":"63.29.38.211"}' http://localhost:9393/sources/turing/data
```

Payloads can only be sent one time, but the entire contents of the payload must be identical in order for it to be rejected as a duplicate. Payloads cannot be sent to unregistered applications.

### Viewing the TrafficSpy Application

Once applications have been registered and payload data sent, the server is started by running the `shotgun` command from the terminal. The main application page can then be found by visiting `http://localhost:9393/` in the browser of your choice.

The following are possible pages you can visit:

#### Registered Applications Index

__Located at:__ `http://localhost:9393/sources`

Has a list of all of the registered applications, each of which is a link to the corresponding applications details page.

#### Application Details
