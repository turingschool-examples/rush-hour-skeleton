RushHour is an application that aggregates and analyzes visitor data from another website. A RushHour customer/client will embed JavaScript in their website that will gather and send their visitor data to our site. We will simulate the process of gathering and receiving data, which we will call a payload. The application accepts the submission of these payloads, analyzes the data submitted, and displays it through an HTML interface.

This is similar to how a tool like Google Analytics might work. When you visit a page that has Google Analytics installed, you don't necessarily see any indication of that on the page, there's just a script that runs in the background and sends your information to Google. We have built the part of the app that receives that information (in the Google Analytics example, this would be on a Google server somewhere), and then displays the information to 'users', which in this case means businesses that pay for the analysis we provide.
