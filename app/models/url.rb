#note that these aren't ``.self` methods (class methods) because they reference a specific url, and not the class Url.
#alisher: gotcha, Erin!
# I didn't touch the methods you created, your testing looks good!
# A few things I noticed:
# - You don't have to pass url as a parameter to these methods, as longs you you call this methods on an instance of Url class
# - Some of these methods are built in Payload, so max_response_time, for example, can be changed to:
# def max_response_time
#   payloads.max_response_time
# end
# Thanks!
