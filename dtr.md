* What does each group member hope to get out of the project? What are your goals and expectations for the project?

> Universally, we all hope to build further understanding on ActiveRecord and PostgreSQL. Individually, Charles would like to focus on some better styling patterns for views, Anna would like to focus on Github practice, and Ryan would like to work on proper ways to split work as well and general workflow.

* When are group members available to work together? What hours can each group member work individually? Are there any personal time commitments that need to be discussed?

> Charles has two things: Thursday (5/19) has a posse meeting, Friday afternoon (5/20) and Sunday afternoon (5/23) possibly for possie activities. Otherwise, available whenever.

> Anna: Wants to keep things done earlier in the evening. Occasional long nights are okay, but need to be discussed.

> Ryan: No work prior to classes, stopping point on weekdays 8pm at latest. Weekends TBD, generally okay.

* How will group members communicate? How often will communication happen, and how will open lines of communication be maintained?

> Group members are expected to maintain an active presence on Slack. New branches, new features, or major changes should be explicitly stated. Notify when a PR is put up in order to have it handled as promptly as possible. Maintain accurate and explicit commit messages and PR descriptions.

* What is each group memberâ€™s self-identified strength(s) technically? What does each group member want to improve on technically? How can the team assist with these improvements?

> Charles: Has a strong SQL background, and feels comfortable with the territory/errors/statement definitions. Would like to improve upon controller interactions and general HTTP. Ryan will help to explain that flow of data, how iVars are passed to views, and various status codes.

> Anna: Fairly comfortable with Sinatra - Robot World went well. HTML and CSS are a grey area. Should come with time. Would like to focus on ActiveRecord. Group will spend extra time on familiarization with ActiveRecord as a whole.

> Ryan: Also comfortable with Sinatra, MVC, etc. Would like to improve upon best-use cases for implementing ActiveRecord/Model Interactions.

* Which feature(s) does each group member want to work on? Which feature(s) does each group member not want to work on?

>

* What is the agreed upon Git workflow? What project management tool will be used? What is the agreed upon procedure for conducting code reviews before merging into master: who will review pull requests, and when?

> Project management will be handled on Waffle, with the first few iterations of tasks entered into Waffle by Ryan, and rotating that responsibility from there on through the project. PR's will be handled based on availability, with prompt response expected (use @channel to notify).

* What is expected of group members when they run into problems implementing a feature?

> Provided its appropriate, members are expected to ask for help after putting in an understandable amount of time. If a given member is conceptually stuck past 20 mins and has no progress made, thats a good time to ask.

* How does each group member want feedback (both positive and constructive) to be delivered?

> Blunt but constructive - general workplace attitude. Don't let negative feelings or concerns stew, and address them immediately. Favor face-to-face commmunication.

* Is there anything else the group should know about personal work/communication styles?

> Group members would like an even amount of pairing/solo work. Try and stay within proximity, but having time to understand things on your own is important. Be aware that when people get frustrated, tensions can get high, and snappiness could occur.
