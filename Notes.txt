$ curl -i -d 'identifier=jumpstartlab&rootUrl=http://jumpstartlab.com'  http://localhost:4567/sources

-i, --include
(HTTP) Include the HTTP-header in the output.
The HTTP-header includes things like server-name, date of the document, HTTP-version and more...

-d
(HTTP) Sends the specified data in a POST request to the HTTP server,
in the same way that a browser does when a user has filled in an HTML form and presses the submit button.
This will cause curl to pass the data to the server using the content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
Compare to -F, --form.
